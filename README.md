Tracking any system involves 
- building a context from different unrelated events & 
- drawing inference from

In this demo simulation, a baggage state/context is built from considering the following disparate events
- Checkouts, 											emanating from a checkout processing system
- RFIDs,                          emanating from sensors as bags move about prior to loading & after unloading
- Flight arrivals & departures,   emanating from a flight monitoring system,
to detect bags, that miss flights carrying the affected passengers, and notify airlines for proactive action taking

- Flight arrivals & departures,   emanating from a flight monitoring system,
(Why)
to detect bags, that miss flights carrying the affected passengers, and 
notify airlines for remedial actions proactively.
